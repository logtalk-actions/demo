The [`testing`](https://github.com/logtalk-actions/demo/blob/master/.github/workflows/testing.yml) workflow makes available a TAP report and a code coverage report as build artifacts. Navigate to the commits list, select the latest successful commit, and go into the build details (green check mark) to download the build artifacts. The code coverage report is also published to [https://logtalk-actions.github.io/demo/coverage_report.html](https://logtalk-actions.github.io/demo/coverage_report.html).
